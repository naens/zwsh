#+TITLE: Description of block behaviour

* Block display
 * ~^KH~: switch on or off
 * off when no ~<B>~ and no ~<K>~
 * if ~<B>~ and/or ~<K>~ are present, can be on or off
 * turns automatically on if from the off state ~<B>~ or ~<K>~ are defined
 * ~<B>~ and ~<K>~ are defined by ~^KB~ and ~^KK~ respectively
 * when displayed, if ~^KB~ or ~^KK~ are used when the cursor is at ~<B>~ or ~<K>~
(displayed right after), ~<B>~ or ~<K>~ are removed
 * if not displayed, they are made visible
 * ~<B>~ and ~<K>~ are displayed as ~<B>~ and ~<K>~ standout when there is
only one of them or the position of ~<K>~ is less or equal to the position
of ~<B>~, otherwise <B> and <K> are not visible and the characters between
 are made standout
 * if ~<B>~ and ~<K>~ are on the same position, ~<B>~ is displayed before
~<K>~

* Editing
 * The cursor is never on the standout part of ~<B>~ or ~<K>~

* Column mode
 * ~^KN~ turns on and off column mode (default if off)
 * in column mode what is selected and what is copied is the rectangle from
~<B>~ to ~<K>~
 * in order for the rectangle to appear, the column of ~<K>~ must be greater
than the column of ~<B>~
 * ~^KI~ turns on or off the column replace mode (default is off)
 * when the column replace mode is on, it replaces the content of the
columns instead of inserting
 * when inserting text in the selection when in column mode, the selection
does not move
 * there is no standout selection if one of the selected lines ends before
the column of ~<K>~
