* Tests
The directory *tests* contains tests to test different modules independently
from the whole application.  Also allows to test features and cases rarely or
not used in the main application, which could be useful in future versions.

* To do plan
** wsline
 + [DONE] Test edit, navigation, functionality

** wsdialog
 + Pre-fill (ex. filename for save functions...)

** wsedit
Without implementing wsblock keybindings, finish wsedit mode:
 + [DONE] keybindings
 + [DONE] import from file
 + [DONE] exit saving / not saving / putting into buffer wsedit mode
 + [DONE] enter wsedit mode: using buffer / using file
 + [DONE] add fullscreen mode
 + fullscreen mode
   - switch with keybinding
   - only fullscreen possible when file with too many lines
 + [DONE] add vertical scroll
 + add horizontal scroll
 + add pipe mode: command that reads pipe and displays it in editor
 + add command mode: command with argument a file name: reads and displays
 in editor

** wsblock
Rewrite wsblock for edit, normal and wsline modes:
 + review wsblock specifications, redefine behaviour, parameters, variables...
 + implement marks: places that move with the text: track position, column, line
(also for wsline)
 + reimplement block functionality, on wsline, substitute CR's and LF's with a
normal character, like space or a special substitution character (in order to
restore space if copying to edit or normal mode)
 + test on normal, edit and wsline modes
 + add column selection

** prompt
 + Directory aliases
 + Directory alias completion (alias completion + subpath completion)

** global
 + delete & undelete: ws style
 + organize files: wskeys <--> wstext
 + functions in wsfun, wstxtfun: remove unused / merge similar by making
functions general

** add superuser functionality
 + if no right to read/write, display superuser prompt 
 + when opening read only file: add to status bar (? disallow editing ?)
