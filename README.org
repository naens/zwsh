 - edit multiline commands,
 - import and export from and to files.

========

* To do plan

** wsedit
Without implementing wsblock keybindings, finish wsedit mode:
 + keybindings
 + import from file
 + exit saving / not saving / putting into buffer wsedit mode
 + enter wsedit mode: using buffer / using file
 + add fullscreen mode and vertical scroll

** wsline
Add horizontal scroll

** wsblock
rewrite wsblock for edit, normal and wsline modes
 + review wsblock specifications, redefine behaviour, parameters, variables...
 + implement marks: places that move with the text: track position, column,
line
 + reimplement block functionality, on wsline, substitute CR's and LF's with
a normal character, like space or a special substitution character (in order
to restore space if copying to edit or normal mode)
 + test on normal, edit and wsline modes
 + add column selection

** add superuser functionality
 + if no right to read/write, display superuser prompt 
 + when opening read only file: add to status bar (? disallow editing ?)
