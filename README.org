---------

* To do plan
** wsline
 + [DONE] Test edit, navigation, functionality

** wsdialog
 + Pre-fill (ex. filename for save functions...)

** wsedit
Without implementing wsblock keybindings, finish wsedit mode:
 + [DONE] keybindings
 + [DONE] import from file
 + [DONE] exit saving / not saving / putting into buffer wsedit mode
 + [DONE] enter wsedit mode: using buffer / using file
 + [DONE] add fullscreen mode
 + fullscreen mode
   - switch with keybinding
   - only fullscreen possible when file with too many lines
 + [DONE] add vertical scroll
 + [DONE] add horizontal scroll

** CLI tools
 * pipe mode: command that reads pipe and displays it in editor
 * mode: command with argument a file name: reads and displays in editor

** wsblock
Rewrite wsblock for edit, normal and wsline modes:
 + [DONE]review wsblock specifications, redefine behaviour, parameters, variables...
 + [DONE]implement marks: places that move with the text: track position, column, line
(also for wsline)
 + column selection
 + wsedit: right border wsblock
 + insert and move blocks
 + reimplement block functionality, on wsline, substitute CR's and LF's with a
normal character, like space or a special substitution character (in order to
restore space if copying to edit or normal mode)

** prompt
 + Directory aliases
 + Directory alias completion (alias completion + subpath completion)

** Marks
[DONE]
Marks are points in text which have a name and are moved when text get
inserted or deleted (they don't get deleted with the text, if a selection
containing a mark is deleted, the mark is moved to the beginning of the
selection. ~<B>~ and ~<K>~ are marks.

*** Implementation of Marks
[DONE]
Marks have a name and a location, they are associated with a location in
text and can move when text is deleted or inserted.

Marks are stored in an array (wstext_marks), where each element is a pair name
position.

** global
 + [DONE] implement the array of marks in the text
 + delete & undelete: ws style
 + organize files: wskeys <--> wstext
 + functions in wsfun, wstxtfun: remove unused / merge similar by making
functions general
 + refresh on screen resize
 + write wiki documentation
 + use wiki for todo lists

** add superuser functionality
 + if no right to read/write, display superuser prompt 
 + when opening read only file: add to status bar (? disallow editing ?)
